Now, contribution of this repo can be of many types:

So, better read the code of conduct and guidelines of this repo before contribution.

**NOTE: All issues and pull requests will be thoroughly reviewed by me and auto-tests will also be performed. So, no spamming! Else, your PR will be considered invalid!**

So, here's a brief overview for contributing,

1. Go to Issues to raise a notif first, you may be redirected to the templates section of what you want to do, (Bug report, Security Vulnerability, Documentation request), if not, create one from scratch using **blank issue**
