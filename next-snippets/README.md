# next-snippets README

Hello everybody, and thanks for using the next-snippets extension first of all! This extension helps you to put basic ML Code templates in Python! Some are yet to come, but it is developed for users who are learning ML and Data Science for the first time! xD

Some commands for invoking the code snippets are given below!

## Code snippets and commands

`!dat` - To invoke basic import of Data Science libraries

`!nntmp` - To import Tensorflow and Keras

`!encode` - To use the OneHotEncoder

`!encody` - To use Encoder in case of variable 'y'

`!train` - To import the split-dataset template

`!plt` - To import the graphing template

`!import` - To call the import dataset template

`!nnmodel` - To invoke a neural network of single neuron

`!epoch` - To train a Neural Network

`!nncompl` - Import a NN (suitable for CV, MNIST etc)

`!iris` - Import a Iris dataset for example! xD

**More yet to come!**


## Requirements

1. Python 3.6 or later

2. Tensorflow 2.x (Keras will be included)

3. Pandas

4. Matplotlib

5. Numpy

6. Scikit-learn

## Known Issues

So far, no issues reported!

## Release Notes
